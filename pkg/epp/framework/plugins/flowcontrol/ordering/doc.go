// Package ordering provides the standard implementations of the OrderingPolicy interface.
//
// # Context: The 3-Tier Dispatch Hierarchy
//
// The Flow Control system manages traffic using a strict three-tier decision hierarchy.
// This package implements Tier 3.
//
//  1. Priority (Band Selection):
//     The system first strictly selects the highest-priority Band that has pending work.
//
//  2. Fairness (Flow Selection):
//     Once a Band is selected, the FairnessPolicy (interflow) determines which Flow within that band gets the next
//     dispatch opportunity.
//
//  3. Ordering (Item Selection) - [THIS PACKAGE]:
//     Once a Flow is selected, the OrderingPolicy determines which Request from that specific flow's queue is
//     dispatched. This governs the "internal discipline" of the flow (e.g., whether to serve oldest requests first or
//     most urgent).
//
// # Architecture: The Flyweight Pattern
//
// Ordering Policies are Singletons. A single instance handles the ordering logic for all queues in a Priority Band.
// To support this efficiently, the policy follows the Flyweight pattern:
//
//  1. The Plugin Instance (e.g., FCFS) is a Singleton. It defines the Logic (Less).
//  2. The Logic (Less) acts as a pure function (or comparator) that operates on the queue's items.
//
// # Standard Implementations
//
// This package includes the following core strategies:
//
//   - FCFS ("First-Come, First-Served") ("fcfs-ordering-policy"): Orders requests by their logical arrival time.
//     This is the default and most "intuitive" ordering.
//
//   - EDF ("Earliest Deadline First") ("edf-ordering-policy"): Orders requests by their absolute deadline
//     (EnqueueTime + TTL).
//     This maximizes the number of requests served before their deadlines expire.
//
//   - SLO Deadline ("slo-deadline-ordering-policy"): Orders requests by an SLO-based (service level objective) deadline
//     computed as ReceivedTimestamp + x-llm-d-slo-ttft-ms header (interpreted as milliseconds).
//     Requests without a valid header are scheduled after SLO-bound requests.
//     This maximizes the number of requests served before the deadlines computed on the defined SLO expire.
