# Disaggregated Inference Serving in llm-d

## Overview

This document describes the architecture and request lifecycle for enabling **disaggregated inference execution** in the llm-d Router. llm-d supports multiple disaggregation topologies:

- **EPD** (no disaggregation) – a single node handles all three functions (encode, prefill, and decode). This is the default mode when no disaggregation is configured.
- **P/D** (Prefill/Decode) – separates the prefill and decode stages onto different workers. This is functionally equivalent to EP/D, since prefill workers also handle encoding (multimodal processing) as part of the prefill stage.
- **E/PD** (Encode/Prefill-Decode) – offloads multimodal encoding to dedicated workers while a single worker handles prefill and decode.
- **E/P/D** (Encode/Prefill/Decode) – the full three-stage pipeline where each stage runs on a specialized worker.

> [!NOTE] 
> The Encode (E) stage is only relevant for requests with multimodal content (images, video, or audio). For text-only requests, the encode stage is skipped regardless of the configured topology.

> [!WARNING]
> Encode disaggregation (E/PD and E/P/D) is under active development in both vLLM and llm-d-router.
> The implementation described here is a proof of concept (PoC) and is subject to change.

All topologies are driven by the unified `disagg-profile-handler` plugin, which selects active stages based on configuration, the user request (e.g., presence of multimodal content), and the system status (e.g., KV-cache hit ratio on the selected decode pod). The architecture aims to improve flexibility, scalability, and performance by enabling separation of inference stages onto different workers.

---

## Goals

- Enable routing of encode, prefill, and decode to different workers
- Maintain low latency and high throughput
- Improve resource utilization by specializing pods for each stage
- Support multimodal workloads by offloading encoding to dedicated workers
- Align with GIE-compatible architectures for potential upstreaming

## Key Components

| Component            | Role                                                                         |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Encode Worker**    | Handles multimodal encoding (images, video, audio) for E/PD and E/P/D       |
| **Prefill Worker**   | Handles prefill stage using vLLM engine; in EP/D configuration, also handles encoding for multimodal requests |
| **Decode Worker**    | Handles decode stage and contains the sidecar for coordination               |
| **Sidecar (Decode)** | Orchestrates communication with encode/prefill workers and manages lifecycle |
| **Envoy Proxy**      | Accepts OpenAI-style requests and forwards them to EPP                       |
| **EPP**              | Endpoint Picker, makes scheduling decisions                                  |

## Request Lifecycle

### P/D (Prefill/Decode)

1. **User Request** – Sent via OpenAI API to the Envoy Proxy
2. **EPP Scheduling Decision** – The `disagg-profile-handler` runs stages in order:
   1. **Decode**: always runs first, selects a decode pod
   2. **Prefill** (optional): the PD decider evaluates prompt length and prefix-cache hit; if disaggregation is warranted, a prefill pod is selected
3. **Execution** – Request lands on Decode Worker:
   - If `x-prefiller-host-port` header doesn't exist → runs both stages locally
   - If `x-prefiller-host-port` header exists → sidecar sends prefill to the selected Prefill Worker, then runs decode locally
4. **Response Flow** – decode sidecar → Envoy → EPP → User

### E/PD (Encode/Prefill-Decode)

For multimodal requests (images, video, audio), the encode stage can be disaggregated to dedicated workers:

1. **User Request** – Multimodal request sent via OpenAI API
2. **EPP Scheduling Decision** – The `disagg-profile-handler` runs stages in order:
   1. **Decode**: selects a decode pod
   2. **Encode** (optional): the encode decider checks for multimodal content; if present, an encode pod is selected
3. **Execution** – Request lands on Decode Worker:
   - If encode was scheduled → sidecar sends encoding work to the selected Encode Worker(s) via the `x-encoder-hosts-ports` header
   - Encode Worker processes multimodal content and returns encoding metadata (embedding references)
   - Decode Worker reads embeddings via EC_Connector and runs prefill + decode locally
4. **Response Flow** – decode sidecar → Envoy → EPP → User

### E/P/D (Encode/Prefill/Decode)

The full three-stage pipeline combines both encode and prefill disaggregation:

1. **User Request** – Multimodal request sent via OpenAI API
2. **EPP Scheduling Decision** – The `disagg-profile-handler` runs all three stages in order:
   1. **Decode**: selects a decode pod
   2. **Encode** (optional): if multimodal content is detected, an encode pod is selected
   3. **Prefill** (optional): if the PD decider determines disaggregation is beneficial, a prefill pod is selected
3. **Execution** – Request lands on Decode Worker:
   - If encode was scheduled → sidecar sends encoding work to the selected Encode Worker(s) via the `x-encoder-hosts-ports` header
   - Encode Worker processes multimodal content and returns encoding metadata (embedding references)
   - If prefill was scheduled → sidecar sends prefill to Prefill Worker via the `x-prefiller-host-port` header
   - Prefill Worker reads embeddings via EC_Connector and executes prefill operation
   - Decode Worker runs decode locally
4. **Response Flow** – decode sidecar → Envoy → EPP → User

### Sidecar Responsibilities (Decode Only)

- Receives EPP metadata (decode pod, optional encode pod(s), optional prefill pod)
- If encode endpoints are present, sends multimodal content to Encode Worker(s), waits for results and validates them
- If prefill endpoint is present, sends prefill request to Prefill Worker, waits for results and validates them
- Launches local decode job
- Sends final response

> [!NOTE]
> No sidecar or coordination logic is needed on the prefill or encode nodes.

---

## Worker Selection Logic

- **Decode Worker**: Prefer longest prefix match / kv-cache utilization (depends on available scorers) and low load
- **Prefill Worker**: Same scoring criteria as decode
- **Encode Worker**: Selected when multimodal content is detected in the request

> **Skip prefill** when:
> - Prefix match / kv-cache hit is high
> - Prompt is very short

> **Skip encode** when:
> - Request contains no multimodal content (text-only)
> - Encode decider rejects the request

---


## Drawbacks & Limitations

- Slight increase in TTFT for disaggregated P/D and E/P/D
- Additional network hops for E/P/D (encode → prefill → decode)
- Possibility of stranded memory on prefill crash
- The need for timeout and retry logic

---

## Design Benefits

- **Flexibility**: Enables per-request specialization and resource balancing
- **Scalability**: Clean separation of concerns for easier ops and tuning
- **Upstream-ready**: Follows GIE-compatible request handling
- **Minimal Changes**: Only decode node includes orchestration sidecar

---

## Future Considerations

- Cache coordination (we can talk about 3 different types of cache: KV-cache, embeddings, and multimedia content)
- Pre-allocation of kv blocks in the decode node, push cache from the prefill to the decode worker during calculation
- More sophisticated encode worker selection (e.g., load-aware scheduling, cache content, locality-aware placement)

---

## Integrating External Prefill/Decode Workloads

The llm-d Router supports integration with external disaggregated encode/prefill/decode (E/P/D) workloads or other inference frameworks that follow the same E/P/D separation pattern but use **different Kubernetes Pod labeling conventions**.

### Labeling Convention Flexibility

By default, llm-d uses the label key `llm-d.ai/role` with values:
- `"encode"` → encode-only pods (multimodal encoding)
- `"prefill"` → prefill-only pods
- `"decode"` → decode-capable pods
- `"encode-prefill"` → pods capable of both encode and prefill (EP/D or P/D)
- `"encode-decode"` → pods capable of both encode and decode (E/PD, rare)
- `"prefill-decode"` → pods capable of both prefill and decode
- `"encode-prefill-decode"` → pods capable of all three stages
- `"both"` → **deprecated** (use `"prefill-decode"` instead)

However, external systems may use alternative labels like:
```yaml
role: encode
role: prefill
role: decode
```

To accommodate this **without code changes**, you can configure the **EndpointPickerConfig** to use the generic `label-selector-filter` plugin instead of the hardcoded `encode-filter` / `prefill-filter` / `decode-filter`.

> [!NOTE]
> The previous filter type `by-label` is deprecated. Use `label-selector-filter` with standard Kubernetes label selector syntax instead.

## Deciders

Deciders are handler plugins responsible for determining whether a disaggregated stage should be executed for a given request.

### PD Deciders

PD deciders determine whether prefill should be offloaded to a separate worker, based on the properties of the request prompt.

#### Prefix-Based PD Decider

The `prefix-based-pd-decider` plugin makes the disaggregation decision according to the length of the non-cached suffix of the prompt relative to tokens already cached on the selected decode pod.

**How It Works**
- Once a decode pod is selected, the decider checks how many tokens from the incoming prompt have already been sent to this pod

- If the remaining non-cached suffix length is longer than the configured threshold (nonCachedTokens), disaggregation is triggered – the prefill will run remotely on a prefill pod, and decode locally on the decode pod

- If the non-cached suffix is shorter or equal to the threshold, the full request runs locally on the decode worker without remote prefill

**Configuration**
```yaml
- type: prefix-based-pd-decider
  parameters:
    nonCachedTokens: 8
```

**Parameter:**

- `nonCachedTokens`: Number of non-cached tokens that trigger disaggregation
  - If set to 0, disaggregation never occurs for any request

#### Always-Disagg PD Decider
The `always-disagg-pd-decider` is a simpler alternative used mainly for testing or benchmarking.
It always triggers disaggregation, regardless of prefix cache state or prompt characteristics.

**Configuration example:**

```yaml
- type: always-disagg-pd-decider
```

> [!NOTE]
> This plugin accepts no parameters.

It’s useful for validating end-to-end prefill/decode splitting and comparing system performance under forced disaggregation.

### Encode Deciders

Encode deciders determine whether multimodal encoding should be offloaded to dedicated encode workers.

#### Always Disagg Multimodal Decider

The `always-disagg-multimodal-decider` triggers encode disaggregation whenever the request contains multimodal content (images, video, or audio). Text-only requests are never sent to encode workers.

**Configuration example:**

```yaml
- type: always-disagg-multimodal-decider
```

> [!NOTE]
> This plugin accepts no parameters.

It checks for the presence of `image_url`, `video_url`, or `input_audio` content blocks in the chat-completions request body. If any multimodal content is found, the encode stage is activated.

---

## Profile Handler Configuration

The `disagg-profile-handler` plugin is the entry point for all disaggregation topologies. Active stages are determined by which deciders are configured.

### Parameters

- `profiles` (optional): names of the scheduling profiles to use.
  - `decode` (default: `decode`)
  - `prefill` (default: `prefill`)
  - `encode` (default: `encode`)
- `deciders` (optional): decider plugins that control whether each stage runs.
  - `prefill`: enables P/D disaggregation when set.
  - `encode`: enables E disaggregation when set.

### Examples

#### Decode-only (no disaggregation)

No deciders are configured -- all requests are handled by the decode profile alone.

```yaml
- type: disagg-profile-handler
```

#### P/D (Prefill/Decode)

```yaml
- type: disagg-profile-handler
  parameters:
    deciders:
      prefill: prefix-based-pd-decider
```

Custom profile names (if your scheduling profiles are not named `decode`/`prefill`):

```yaml
- type: disagg-profile-handler
  parameters:
    profiles:
      decode: my-decode
      prefill: my-prefill
    deciders:
      prefill: prefix-based-pd-decider
```

#### E/PD (Encode/Prefill-Decode)

```yaml
- type: disagg-profile-handler
  parameters:
    deciders:
      encode: always-disagg-multimodal-decider
```

#### E/P/D (Encode/Prefill/Decode)

```yaml
- type: disagg-profile-handler
  parameters:
    deciders:
      prefill: prefix-based-pd-decider
      encode: always-disagg-multimodal-decider
```
